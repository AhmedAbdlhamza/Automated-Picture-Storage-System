# Automated-Picture-Storage-System
here's a complete Python script that automatically uploads images captured by the robot to Amazon S3 and manages the internal memory. This example assumes that the captured images are saved in a specific directory and that you have the necessary AWS credentials. 

 
# Prerequisites:
1-Install the required Python packages:
``` pip install boto3 watchdog ```
2-Set up your AWS credentials in your environment or in "~/.aws/credentials".

Replace <your_bucket_name> with your Amazon S3 bucket name and <path_to_images_directory> with the path to the directory where the robot's images are stored.
